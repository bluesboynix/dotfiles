# My Dotfiles

Personal, modular dotfiles and scripts managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Clean, minimal, and easily reproducible across systems.


## ðŸ›  Structure

Each application or tool has its own folder and mirrors its target location in `$HOME`. This makes it easy to symlink everything with `stow`.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluesboynix/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```
# Symlink configs with GNU Stow:
```bash
stow emacs foot hypr nvim rofi waybar wlogout yazi zathura zsh
```
